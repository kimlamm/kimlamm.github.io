        <p> The fallen leaves tell a story. <br>

            The great Elden Ring was shattered. <br>
            
            In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between. <br>
            
            Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found, <br>
            
            and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was the first to perish. <br>
            
            Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. <br>
            
            The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering. <br>
            
            A war from which no lord arose. <br>
            
            A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will. <br>
            
            Arise now, ye Tarnished. <br>
            
            Ye dead, who yet live. <br>
            
            The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all. <br>
            
            Hoarah Loux, chieftan of the badlands. <br>
            
            The ever-brilliant Goldmask. <br>
            
            Fia, the Deathbed Companion. <br>
            
            The loathsome Dung Eater. <br>
            
            And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing. <br>
            
            And one other. Whom grace would again bless. <br>
            
            A Tarnished of no renown. <br>
            
            Cross the fog, to the Lands Between. <br>
            
            To stand before the Elden Ring. <br>
            
            And become the Elden Lord.</p>
